I loved kids.

Especially toddlers.

Thinking back to my first baby, I did mine and his first "Blast off".

Pretty simple I guess.

Just count down from 3 to 1, yell Blast Off! and pick him up and twist him around in hte air a bit and occasionally "get" his belly.

The screams of laughter were addictive to me as much as him.

I did this with all my kids and it grew to all the vieces and nephews and friends.

At one point there were 7 kids lined up to blast off.

Made for a long night of laughing little kids.

I was known for it in the extended family even.

I was proud of the fact all the kids looked forward to coming to our house.

It was a family joke for years after they all got too big for me to Blast them off.

A great memory.

Then the Grand kids started coming and Poppy got another round. 

I have enjoyed another 10 years of Blast offs.

Sitting tonight and thinking after another round of 3, 4 bwas off as my youngest grand daughter calls it.

This is likely the last baby that I will have the pleasure of Blasting off...

Bitter sweet.

Hell, just bitter I guess, at least until she comes back in 5 minutes Lol. 

And off we go again. Live for the moment! 



My favorite terms for play time:

"bwas off" : Blast Off! The one that started them all.

"updown" : Depending on context, as simple as holding them and stnding up and sitting down again fast. In the extended version it is mixed with other activities like BwasOff and IggyAck where it means to jostle them around a bit generally in a up down direction.

"iggy ack" : Piggy Back usually including a round of up downs

"Hand Sink" : Wash hands in the sing (AKA play in the water)
