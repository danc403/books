The Divergent Paths of MAYA and BODHI
MAYA, their second child, was opinionated from her first coherent babble. As a baby, she possessed a fierce self-centeredness, demanding attention with a powerful cry and a clear preference for her own comfort. ANANDA, ever observant, noted it, but attributed it to her sharp intellect and strong will. "She knows her mind, Lakshmi," he'd say, a touch of admiration in his voice, even as he found himself navigating her stubbornness. This trait continued through her childhood and adolescence. She was bright, articulate, and fiercely independent, but her opinions, while often well-reasoned, were rarely swayed by others. She navigated the increasing chaos of their new home with a certain detached pragmatism, less overtly swayed by LAKSHMI's hoarding or SIDDHA's burgeoning troubles than her brothers. She often clashed with LAKSHMI, finding her mother's disorganization and emotional volatility deeply frustrating, a stark contrast to her own desire for clarity and order.
However, even MAYA, with her formidable will, could not escape the pervasive influence of their surroundings. She, too, inadvertently fell into the orbit of the "wrong crowd" that had drawn SIDDHA. Not with the same self-destructive abandon, but in ways that twisted her early life. Her sharp intellect allowed her to navigate their complexities, but her strong opinions, coupled with a yearning for belonging that every child seeks, led her to defend actions that were morally ambiguous. This subtle but significant deviation from ANANDA’s principles ultimately led to a first marriage that mirrored the detrimental qualities she saw in her brothers’ chosen companions – perhaps to a man whose ambition bordered on ruthlessness, or whose charming demeanor masked a lack of true integrity, or even one entangled in the very habits of the "wrong crowd." This union, while not overtly destructive at first, was built on a foundation of compromise and dissatisfaction, a stark contrast to the harmonious life ANANDA had envisioned for his daughter.
Early adulthood brought MAYA some very hard times. Her strong opinions sometimes led to conflict within her marriage, and her self-reliance, while a strength, occasionally veered into isolation. She experienced periods of loneliness and professional setbacks that tested her resolve. ANANDA watched, offering quiet support, knowing that some lessons, even the hardest ones, had to be learned through direct experience. But it was the painful ending of this first marriage that became the crucible of her transformation. Divorced and with a young son, she found herself stripped bare of illusions. The responsibilities of single motherhood, the profound love for her child, pushed her beyond her ingrained self-centeredness. This forced her to confront her own choices, to see the consequences of her past associations with stark clarity.
Her journey of finding her true nature began in earnest as she nurtured her son. She learned empathy, patience, and the profound joy of selfless giving. Her small home became a haven of order and warmth, a deliberate counterpoint to the chaos of her childhood. She started making more conscious choices, seeking stability, nurturing genuine connections, and fostering a sense of harmony in her own immediate family. She married again, this time to a man who shared her evolving values, and together they built a life rooted in mutual respect and clear purpose. ANANDA, observing her quiet strength and deliberate steps, saw her in the process of becoming fully aware, gaining a deeper understanding of cause and effect, even if she didn't articulate it as "karma." She was ascending, step by step, towards a more compassionate and balanced existence.
BODHI, the youngest, was a whirlwind of energy and charm from his earliest days. Flamboyant and naturally fun-loving, he brightened every room he entered. He had a disarming smile and a quick wit that made him instantly popular amongst his peers. ANANDA often found himself laughing more freely with BODHI than with anyone else, his own worries temporarily forgotten in the boy's joyful exuberance. There was an inherent good heart in BODHI, a genuine desire to please and to share joy, a profound wellspring of kindness that shone through his boisterous exterior. However, like SIDDHA and, to a lesser extent, MAYA, BODHI was deeply influenced by the environment of their adolescence in the new, less stable neighborhood. The increasing disarray of their home, coupled with the looser social boundaries outside, created a fertile ground for less wholesome habits to take root.
BODHI’s fun-loving nature, unchecked by the consistent ethical grounding ANANDA had tried so diligently to provide, began to tip towards self-serving tendencies. He cultivated friendships with individuals who prioritized immediate gratification and easy wins, valuing superficial popularity and fleeting pleasures over genuine connection or long-term consequences. As an adult, he continued to hold onto these problematic relationships, often being "the best of the crowd he had chosen" – charismatic, generous within their circle, but ultimately tied to their destructive patterns. His good heart meant he was loyal, almost to a fault, but it was a misguided loyalty, born of ignorance (moha) rather than malice. His vice was bhang (cannabis), consumed often in social settings, contributing to a haze of complacency that dimmed his natural discernment. He would fiercely defend his friends, even when their actions were clearly unethical or harmful to others. Common sense, the very thing ANANDA prided himself on, seemed to abandon BODHI when it came to his chosen companions. He simply did not seem to realize the ultimate cost of these alliances, oblivious to the deeper karmic implications of enabling or defending unskillful behavior. ANANDA often watched him, a knot of worry in his stomach, seeing the immense potential for happiness and genuine connection squandered by a refusal to sever ties that ultimately brought more harm than good. LIAM, despite his caring nature and good intentions, remained susceptible to the ignorance that prevented him from discerning right from wrong in his social circle, a subtle but significant pull towards less conscious states.
 
ANANDA's Deepening Plunge
As the decades advanced, ANANDA’s once unyielding resolve began to fray like a threadbare cloth. He had poured his life force into his family, relentlessly trying to steer them towards the light he so clearly saw, to pull them back from the unseen currents that threatened to drag them under. He continued his quiet efforts, rising before dawn to tend his workshop, coming home to try and impose order on LAKSHMI's chaos, to gently pull SIDDHA back from his stupor, to offer subtle guidance to MAYA, and to warn BODHI about the dangers of his companions. He loved them fiercely, and his efforts stemmed from that profound wellspring of affection, a duty that weighed on him increasingly.
But the constant uphill battle took its toll. His observations of their behaviors, sharpened by years of painful witnessing, led him to an intuitive, unsettling conclusion. Though he knew nothing of Buddhist realms, he saw what he could only describe as animalistic tendencies: the brute instinct driving SIDDHA’s alcoholism, the thoughtless, almost primal loyalty that bound BODHI to his destructive companions, the almost vegetative non-awareness and profound disengagement of LAKSHMI in her hoarding. He saw greed in its various insidious forms – not just financial, but a hunger for self-gratification, a refusal to let go of possessions or grievances, an insatiable craving for things to be their way, regardless of the consequences. This recognition, though unarticulated in the ancient wisdom he would later discover, was chillingly accurate, and it deepened his sense of isolation.
The sheer futility of his tireless efforts began to weigh him down like monsoon clouds laden with rain. The constant striving against the current, the unfulfilled hopes for his loved ones, slowly eroded his spirit. ANANDA, the man who had always been so sturdy, began to experience bouts of profound depression. These weren't fleeting moments of sadness; they were deep, suffocating descents that mirrored the very realms he would later come to understand. He would sit in his silent workshop long after the sun had set, the scent of wood no longer a comfort, but a reminder of the order he could create with his hands but never impose on his family.
When the depression manifested as a gnawing emptiness, an unquenchable thirst for things to be different, a constant feeling of unsatisfied craving for a harmonious family and for his efforts to bear fruit, he was living the reality of a hungry ghost. He’d lie awake, night after night, replaying conversations, strategizing new approaches, but always with the underlying current of yearning for a reality that stubbornly refused to materialize. The generosity he had once seen in LAKSHMI, now twisted into hoarding, became a mirror of his own overwhelming emotional attachment to an ideal family, an attachment that starved him of peace.
At other times, particularly after crushing disappointments – SIDDHA’s latest relapse, or BODHI’s misguided defense of a clearly errant friend, or LAKSHMI's silent, distant gaze – the depression would darken further, transforming into raw anger, bitterness, and despair. These were the moments he slipped into what felt like the hell realm. He'd feel trapped, tormented by his utter inability to change things, consumed by resentment towards the forces—internal and external—that seemed to conspire against his family's well-being. He might lash out verbally, or retreat into a stony silence, his mind a cauldron of anguish and self-blame. The ethical man, the one who would walk away from a dishonest business deal, now found himself wrestling with internal demons far more formidable and insidious than any external challenge.
He recalled, with a bitter irony, the countless times he’d tried to teach his children the value of "the company you keep," trying to explain how friends could lift you up or pull you down, how their influence could shape one’s very destiny. He’d seen it so clearly in SIDDHA and BODHI, the insidious influence of their chosen circles. Yet, with devastating clarity, he realized he himself had, in a way, fallen victim to the "company" of his own persistent, unfulfilled desires and the overwhelming karma of his family. He had allowed their struggles, and his boundless attachment to their "uplift," to drag his own spirit into the very lower realms he unknowingly observed in them.
