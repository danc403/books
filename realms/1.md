The aroma of freshly cut wood, mingled with the faint, sweet scent of sandalwood and old earth, was ANANDA’s private temple. His workshop, nestled in a quiet lane of the bustling, ancient town of Haripur, was more than just a place of trade; it was a sanctuary of principle. ANANDA was a master wood carver and cabinet maker, his hands capable of coaxing intricate patterns from the hardest teak or crafting furniture of exquisite balance. His reputation was built not just on the beauty of his work, but on his unwavering integrity. He used only the finest timber, eschewed quick, shoddy techniques for time-honored methods, and never, not once, had he misled a client about the true cost or quality of his pieces. In a time when the pressure from merchants, eager to cut corners for the burgeoning colonial markets, grew ever stronger, ANANDA’s steadfastness was a quiet defiance. "A man’s word is etched deeper than any carving," he'd often murmur, his fingers tracing the grain of a nascent design.
It was this profound, almost spiritual, rectitude that had first captivated him about LAKSHMI. In her youth, LAKSHMI had possessed a boundless, almost heedless generosity. Her laughter had been a river flowing through the village, washing away worries. She would give rice from their own meager stores to any hungry mendicant, share her own shawl with a shivering stranger, and her hands were always open. ANANDA, precise and deliberate in all things, found himself drawn to this unrestrained warmth, a stark contrast to his own measured existence. He saw in her a soul brimming with an almost divine benevolence, perhaps a little undirected, but with immense potential for growth. He married her not just out of love, but with a silent, fervent hope that his own steadfastness could provide the anchor she needed to fully blossom, to channel her vast spirit into enduring harmony.
Their early years together were a delicate and often testing dance. LAKSHMI’s generosity, while endearing, frequently depleted their household resources, leaving them financially strained. ANANDA would gently, patiently, try to introduce the concept of future needs, of savings for leaner times. He’d suggest planning for the monsoon scarcity or the occasional drought. But her eyes would grow distant, and she’d offer vague assurances before inevitably giving away their last handful of grain to a particularly convincing tale of woe by dusk. He mistook her inability to manage for a lack of worldly understanding, not yet comprehending the deeper currents that pulled at her spirit, making her incapable of holding back.
The birth of SIDDHA, their first child, was, for ANANDA, a profound shift. A tiny, squalling bundle, SIDDHA filled his heart with a fierce protectiveness he hadn’t known possible. But for LAKSHMI, the joy of motherhood was quickly overshadowed by a bewildering and rapid decline. SIDDHA was colicky, a restless, screaming infant who seemed to draw all the sleep and peace from their modest home. ANANDA, ever the practical man, sought remedies, consulted the village elders, held the baby for hours, walking the earthen floor, his mind tirelessly turning over solutions.
LAKSHMI, however, slipped away. The vibrancy that had once defined her dimmed, replaced by a profound weariness that seemed to settle in her bones. Her boundless generosity, once a source of light, began to curdle into something else, something ANANDA couldn't quite grasp at first. She started accumulating things, not just necessities, but everything. Old saris, broken earthenware, faded ritual garlands, sentimental clutter that rapidly filled their small living quarters. Her "giving" became a way to receive, to fill a growing, unseen void within herself. She’d accept offerings or gifts with effusive thanks but rarely use them, instead adding them to the burgeoning piles that began to restrict movement in their home. It wasn't just physical objects; it was emotional hoarding too. She’d cling to slights from years past, to forgotten quarrels, replaying them in her mind with a quiet intensity that disturbed ANANDA deeply. "Why hold onto that, Lakshmi?" he'd ask gently, his voice laced with concern, but she’d just shrug, her eyes distant, as if gazing into a world only she could see.
More troubling was her growing inability to complete tasks. A half-woven pattern would lie abandoned on a loom, or a half-prepared meal would sit cooling, untouched for hours. Promises to sort through ancestral chests would evaporate like morning mist. ANANDA, meticulous by nature, would often step in, quietly finishing what she started, a silent, weary testament to his commitment to maintain order amidst the encroaching chaos. He attributed it to the overwhelming demands of motherhood, the ceaseless wails of their colicky child, and her innate "free spirit" being stifled. He hadn't yet begun to see the deeper, less visible currents of her mind, the post-partum struggles that, unacknowledged and unaddressed by their limited understanding of such ailments, were slowly consuming her. He saw her physical exhaustion, but missed the deeper mental unraveling that required more intervention than he knew how to give.
The years flowed like the Ganges, ceaseless and changing. MAYA, their second child, a girl of keen intellect and sharp opinions, arrived, followed swiftly by BODHI, their youngest son, a whirlwind of natural charm. The household, once neat and orderly, began to buckle under the weight of LAKSHMI’s accumulated possessions and an ever-growing list of unfinished projects. The scent of wood and sandalwood was now often tinged with the faint aroma of dust and neglect. LAKSHMI's hoarding intensified. Their home, while kept clean by ANANDA’s quiet efforts, became a labyrinth of stacked bundles, forgotten crafts, and boxes of unsorted memories. Her generous spirit, which ANANDA had once so admired, had curdled into something else entirely – a desperate grasp, a primal need to possess, a consuming fear of emptiness. She was less engaged, more distracted, her eyes often glazed over as if lost in a fog of her own making, truly entering a state of non-awareness. ANANDA, though he lacked the language for it, instinctively felt she was becoming lost, swallowed by an unseen void.
A series of devastating events began to unravel their precarious stability. The broader economic downturn, likely exacerbated by the colonial administration's policies that favored large-scale production over traditional crafts, began to bite hard. Orders for ANANDA's intricate carvings dwindled, replaced by demands for cheaper, mass-produced items. Then, a few unethical merchants, to whom ANANDA had refused to compromise his standards, managed to corner the remaining market, leaving him with little work. His deep-seated integrity, while saving his soul, began to starve his family. The pressure became unbearable.
They were forced to sell their beloved workshop and dwelling, the ancestral home that had sheltered generations of craftsmen. They moved to a smaller, more affordable dwelling in a less prosperous part of Haripur, a district where the lanes were narrower, the houses more crowded, and the struggle for survival more evident. It was a place where different rules applied, where the lines between right and wrong were often blurred by desperation, and where casual experimentation with less wholesome pastimes was more prevalent than the quiet devotion ANANDA cherished.
This forced relocation was a turning point, especially for SIDDHA. ANANDA, looking back later, would recall the earnest conversations he tried to have with his children about the importance of choosing their companions wisely. "Tell me who you walk with, and I will tell you who you are," he'd often say, a timeless adage he hoped would resonate with them. But in this new environment, where the boundaries of their home life had already softened under the weight of LAKSHMI's decline, SIDDHA found himself drawn to a crowd that offered excitement, a sense of belonging that perhaps felt missing amidst their family’s growing troubles. They were not inherently evil boys, but they were largely directionless, driven by impulse, and prone to chasing instant gratification. SIDDHA, with his fundamentally good heart, found himself pulled along, a silent current carrying him away from the steady shore ANANDA had tried so desperately to build.
