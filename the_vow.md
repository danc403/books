The VOW:

You fill my wants and needs,
I wish to be the remedy for yours.
If I now or ever fail to meet your desires,
May you find resolution.

I hope to always be,
the support that you will need.

The future holds uncertainties,
a path unwritten, unseen,
a steady, basic scene.

when times of trial are read,
partners in life are bread.
