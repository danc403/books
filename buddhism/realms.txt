Realms in Buddhism refer to the different planes of existence that sentient beings can inhabit after death. These realms are determined by one's karma, or the law of cause and effect. The realms are categorized into three higher realms, three lower realms, and the human realm.
Higher Realms:
1. Deva Realm: This realm is characterized by happiness, pleasure, and luxury. Devas are beings of great beauty, intelligence, and power.
2. Asural Realm: This realm is characterized by conflict, jealousy, and pride. Asuras are often depicted as powerful but arrogant beings.
3. Brahma Realm: This realm is characterized by tranquility, peace, and wisdom. Brahmas are beings of great spiritual attainment and are often associated with creation.
Lower Realms:
1. Hell Realm: This realm is characterized by intense suffering, pain, and punishment. Hell beings are often depicted as suffering from various torments.
2. Animal Realm: This realm is characterized by ignorance, instinct, and suffering. Animals are often depicted as living simple, instinctual lives.
3. Hungry Ghost Realm: This realm is characterized by insatiable hunger and thirst. Hungry ghosts are often depicted as beings with large bellies and narrow necks, unable to satisfy their cravings.
Human Realm:
The human realm is considered a unique realm because it offers the potential for enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Humans are capable of both good and evil actions, and their future realms are determined by their karma.
It's important to note that these realms are not static and can change based on one's actions and karma. A person can be reborn in a higher or lower realm depending on their moral conduct and spiritual development. The goal of Buddhist practice is to break free from the cycle of rebirth and attain enlightenment, leading to liberation from suffering and the attainment of Nibbana.
