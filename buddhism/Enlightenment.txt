Path and stages of Enlightenment.

Sotapanna is a term used in Buddhism to describe a person who has attained the first stage of enlightenment. It is one of the four stages of enlightenment on the path to Arhatship.
A Sotapanna is characterized by:
• Stream-entry: This means that the person has entered the stream leading to Nibbana (enlightenment). Once they have entered this stream, they are guaranteed to reach Nibbana in future lives.
• Faith: They have unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines.
• Wisdom: They have gained some understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
A Sotapanna is not yet fully enlightened, but they have made significant progress on the path. They are no longer subject to the lowest realms of existence (hell, animal, and hungry ghost) and are guaranteed to reach Nibbana within seven lifetimes.
The next stages of enlightenment are:
• Sakadagami: Once-returner
• Anagami: Non-returner
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Sakadagami is the second stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who is destined to return to the human realm only once more before reaching Nibbana (enlightenment).
A Sakadagami is characterized by:
• Once-returner: They are guaranteed to return to the human realm only one more time before attaining Nibbana.
• Strong faith: They have a strong faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines.
• Wisdom: They have gained a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment compared to a Sotapanna.
A Sakadagami has made significant progress on the path to enlightenment, but they still have some attachments and defilements that need to be overcome before reaching Nibbana. However, their future is assured, and they are destined to attain enlightenment in their next life.
The next stages of enlightenment are:
• Anagami: Non-returner
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Anagami is the third stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who is destined to never return to the human realm after their current life.
An Anagami is characterized by:
• Non-returner: They will not return to the human realm after their current life. They will either attain Nibbana (enlightenment) in this life or be reborn in a heavenly realm.
• Strong faith: They have a very strong faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines to a very high degree.
• Wisdom: They have a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
An Anagami is very close to reaching Nibbana. They have overcome most of their attachments and defilements, and their future is assured. They are destined to attain enlightenment either in this life or in the next.
The final stage of enlightenment is:
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Arhat is the highest stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who has completely eradicated all defilements and attachments, and has attained the state of Nibbana (enlightenment).
An Arhat is characterized by:
• Fully enlightened: They have achieved the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the complete cessation of suffering and the attainment of Nibbana.
• Perfect wisdom: They have a perfect understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
• Complete freedom: They are free from all attachments, defilements, and suffering.
• Compassion: They have boundless compassion for all beings and strive to help others on the path to enlightenment.
Becoming an Arhat is the ultimate goal of many Buddhists. It represents the complete liberation from the cycle of suffering and the attainment of ultimate happiness and peace.
