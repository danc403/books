Book: 4nobletruths.txt

The Four Noble Truths are fundamental teachings in Buddhism that provide a framework for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. They are:    
1. Dukkha: This translates to "suffering" or "unsatisfactoriness." It encompasses all forms of suffering, including physical pain, mental anguish, and the inherent impermanence of life.
2. The Origin of Dukkha: This refers to the causes of suffering, which are rooted in ignorance, craving, and clinging.
3. The Cessation of Dukkha: This is the possibility of ending suffering through the eradication of its causes.
4. The Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha: This is the Eightfold Path, a practical guide for achieving liberation from suffering through ethical conduct, mental development, and wisdom.
These four truths form the core of the Buddhist understanding of the human condition and the path to enlightenment.

Expanding on the Four Noble Truths
1. Dukkha:
• Physical suffering: This includes pain, illness, and disability.
• Mental suffering: This encompasses negative emotions such as sorrow, anger, fear, and frustration.
• Existential suffering: This arises from the inherent impermanence of life, the unsatisfactoriness of worldly pleasures, and the inevitability of separation.
2. The Origin of Dukkha:
• Ignorance: This refers to a lack of understanding of the true nature of reality, leading to mistaken beliefs and desires.
• Craving: This is the desire for things that are impermanent, unsatisfactory, or harmful.
• Clinging: This is the attachment to things that are impermanent, unsatisfactory, or harmful.
3. The Cessation of Dukkha:
• Nirvana: This is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the complete cessation of suffering. It is a state of liberation from ignorance, craving, and clinging.
• Enlightenment: This is the realization of the true nature of reality and the attainment of Nirvana.
4. The Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha:
• The Eightfold Path: This is a practical guide for achieving liberation from suffering. It consists of eight interconnected elements: 
• Right View: Understanding the Four Noble Truths
• Right Thought: Cultivating positive and helpful thoughts
• Right Speech: Speaking truthfully and kindly
• Right Action: Engaging in ethical and compassionate behavior
• Right Livelihood: Earning a living in a way that is ethical and beneficial
• Right Effort: Making a conscious effort to develop positive qualities and eliminate negative ones
• Right Mindfulness: Being present and aware of one's thoughts, feelings, and sensations
• Right Concentration: Cultivating deep and focused meditation
By following the Eightfold Path, Buddhists believe that it is 
possible to overcome suffering and achieve enlightenment.

Book: 5daily.txt

The Five Daily Recollections and Metta are two important practices in Buddhism that help to cultivate mindfulness and compassion.
The Five Daily Recollections are a set of five reminders that are typically recited or meditated upon each morning. They are:
1. I am subject to old age. This reminds us of the impermanence of life and the inevitability of aging.
2. I am subject to disease. This reminds us of the vulnerability of our bodies to illness and suffering.
3. I am subject to death. This reminds us of the finality of life and the importance of making the most of our time.
4. I am the owner of this body, which is perishable. This reminds us that we are not our bodies, but rather the conscious beings that inhabit them.
5. I am the owner of these possessions, which are perishable. This reminds us that material possessions are temporary and do not bring lasting happiness.
Metta is a Pali word that translates to "loving-kindness." It is a meditation practice that involves cultivating feelings of love, kindness, and compassion towards oneself and others. Metta meditation can be done in a variety of ways, but it typically involves focusing on a specific object of meditation, such as oneself, a loved one, a neutral person, or an enemy.
Both the Five Daily Recollections and Metta are important tools for cultivating mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom. By practicing these techniques, Buddhists can develop a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the path to liberation from suffering.

Majjhima Nikāya
148. The Six Sets of Six
Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”—“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; I shall reveal a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure, that is, the six sets of six. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”—“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:
Synopsis
“The six internal bases should be understood. The six external bases should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The six classes of feeling should be understood. The six classes of craving should be understood.
Enumeration
I “‘The six internal bases should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the eye-base, the ear-base, the nose-base, the tongue-base, the body-base, and the mind-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six internal bases should be understood.’ This is the first set of six. 
II “‘The six external bases should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the form-base, the sound-base, the odour-base, the flavour-base, the tangible-base, and the mind-object-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six external bases should be understood. ’ This is the second set of six.
III “‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood. ’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’ This is the third set of six.
IV “‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of contact should be understood. ’ This is the fourth set of six.
V “‘The six classes of feeling should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of feeling should be understood. ’ This is the fifth set of six.
VI “‘The six classes of craving should be understood.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises…with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises…with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises…with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises…with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as condition there is craving. So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The six classes of craving should be understood.’ This is the sixth set of six.
Demonstration of not Self
I “If anyone says, ‘The eye is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the eye are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The eye is self.’ Thus the eye is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Forms are self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Forms are self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Eye-consciousness is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Eye-consciousness is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Eye-contact is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Eye-contact is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Feeling is self’ …That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Feeling is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Craving is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
II “If anyone says, ‘The ear is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the ear are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The ear is self.’ Thus the ear is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Sounds are self,’…‘Ear-consciousness is self,’…‘Ear-contact is self,’…‘Feeling is self,’…‘Craving is self’… That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the ear is not self, sounds are not self, ear-consciousness is not self, ear-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
III “If anyone says, ‘The nose is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the nose are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The nose is self.’ Thus the nose is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Odours are self,’…‘Nose-consciousness is self,’ …‘Nose-contact is self,’…‘Feeling is self,’…‘Craving is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the nose is not self, odours are not self, nose-consciousness is not self, nose-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
IV “If anyone says, ‘The tongue is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the tongue are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The tongue is self.’ Thus the tongue is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Flavours are self,’…‘Tongue-consciousness is self,’…‘Tongue-contact is self,’…‘Feeling is self,’…‘Craving is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the tongue is not self, flavours are not self, tongue-consciousness is not self, tongue-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
V “If anyone says, ‘The body is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the body are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The body is self.’ Thus the body is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Tangibles are self,’…‘Body-consciousness is self,’…‘Body-contact is self,’…‘Feeling is self,’…‘Craving is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the body is not self, tangibles are not self, body-consciousness is not self, body-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
VI “If anyone says, ‘The mind is self,’ that is not tenable. The rise and fall of the mind are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘The mind is self.’ Thus the mind is not self.
“If anyone says, ‘Mind-objects are self,’…‘Mind-consciousness is self,’…‘Mind-contact is self,’…‘Feeling is self,’… … ‘Craving is self’…That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the mind is not self, mind-objects are not self, mind-consciousness is not self, mind-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.
The Origination of Identity
“Now, bhikkhus, this is the way leading to the origination of identity. I One regards the eye thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ One regards forms thus…One regards eye-consciousness thus…One regards eye-contact thus…One regards feeling thus…One regards craving thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’
II–VI “One regards the ear thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’…One regards the nose thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’…One regards the tongue thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’…One regards the body thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’…One regards the mind thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ One regards mind-objects thus…One regards mind-consciousness thus…One regards mind-contact thus…One regards feeling thus…One regards craving thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’
The Cessation of Identity
“Now, bhikkhus, this is the way leading to the cessation of identity. I One regards the eye thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ One regards forms thus…One regards eye-consciousness thus…One regards eye-contact thus…One regards feeling thus…One regards craving thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
II–VI “One regards the ear thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’…One regards the nose thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’…One regards the tongue thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’…One regards the body thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’…One regards the mind thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ One regards mind-objects thus…One regards mind-consciousness thus…One regards mind-contact thus…One regards feeling thus…One regards craving thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
The Underlying Tendencies
I “Bhikkhus, dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a pleasant feeling, if one delights in it, welcomes it, and remains holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust lies within one. When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one sorrows, grieves and laments, weeps beating one’s breast and becomes distraught, then the underlying tendency to aversion lies within one. When one is touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, if one does not understand as it actually is the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to that feeling, then the underlying tendency to ignorance lies within one. Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering without abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling, without abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling, without extirpating the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, without abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge—this is impossible.
II–VI “Bhikkhus, dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises…Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant…Bhikkhus, that one should here and now make an end of suffering without abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling…without abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge—this is impossible. 
The Abandonment of the Underlying Tendencies
I “Bhikkhus, dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a pleasant feeling, if one does not delight in it, welcome it, and remain holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust does not lie within one. When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one does not sorrow, grieve and lament, does not weep beating one’s breast and become distraught, then the underlying tendency to aversion does not lie within one. When one is touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, if one understands as it actually is the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to that feeling, then the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within one. Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling, by abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling, by extirpating the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge—this is possible.
II–VI “Bhikkhus, dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises…Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there arises a feeling felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant…Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make an end of suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling…by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge—this is possible.
Liberation
“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving.
“He becomes disenchanted with the ear…He becomes disenchanted with the nose…He becomes disenchanted with the tongue…Hebecomes disenchanted with the body…He becomes disenchanted with the mind, disenchanted with mind-objects, disenchanted with mind-consciousness, disenchanted with mind-contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving.
“Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion his mind is liberated. When it is liberated, there comes the knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’”
That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words. Now while this discourse was being spoken, through not clinging the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taints.

All eight elements are interconnected and interdependent, and working on one element can support and enhance the others. By following the Eightfold Path, Buddhists believe that it is possible to overcome suffering and achieve enlightenment.

Book: Enlightenment.txt

Path and stages of Enlightenment.

Sotapanna is a term used in Buddhism to describe a person who has attained the first stage of enlightenment. It is one of the four stages of enlightenment on the path to Arhatship.
A Sotapanna is characterized by:
• Stream-entry: This means that the person has entered the stream leading to Nibbana (enlightenment). Once they have entered this stream, they are guaranteed to reach Nibbana in future lives.
• Faith: They have unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines.
• Wisdom: They have gained some understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
A Sotapanna is not yet fully enlightened, but they have made significant progress on the path. They are no longer subject to the lowest realms of existence (hell, animal, and hungry ghost) and are guaranteed to reach Nibbana within seven lifetimes.
The next stages of enlightenment are:
• Sakadagami: Once-returner
• Anagami: Non-returner
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Sakadagami is the second stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who is destined to return to the human realm only once more before reaching Nibbana (enlightenment).
A Sakadagami is characterized by:
• Once-returner: They are guaranteed to return to the human realm only one more time before attaining Nibbana.
• Strong faith: They have a strong faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines.
• Wisdom: They have gained a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment compared to a Sotapanna.
A Sakadagami has made significant progress on the path to enlightenment, but they still have some attachments and defilements that need to be overcome before reaching Nibbana. However, their future is assured, and they are destined to attain enlightenment in their next life.
The next stages of enlightenment are:
• Anagami: Non-returner
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Anagami is the third stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who is destined to never return to the human realm after their current life.
An Anagami is characterized by:
• Non-returner: They will not return to the human realm after their current life. They will either attain Nibbana (enlightenment) in this life or be reborn in a heavenly realm.
• Strong faith: They have a very strong faith in the Buddha, the Dharma (teachings), and the Sangha (community of monks and nuns).
• Virtue: They adhere to the Five Precepts and other moral guidelines to a very high degree.
• Wisdom: They have a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
An Anagami is very close to reaching Nibbana. They have overcome most of their attachments and defilements, and their future is assured. They are destined to attain enlightenment either in this life or in the next.
The final stage of enlightenment is:
• Arhat: Fully enlightened


Arhat is the highest stage of enlightenment in Buddhism. It is a term used to describe a person who has completely eradicated all defilements and attachments, and has attained the state of Nibbana (enlightenment).
An Arhat is characterized by:
• Fully enlightened: They have achieved the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the complete cessation of suffering and the attainment of Nibbana.
• Perfect wisdom: They have a perfect understanding of the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment.
• Complete freedom: They are free from all attachments, defilements, and suffering.
• Compassion: They have boundless compassion for all beings and strive to help others on the path to enlightenment.
Becoming an Arhat is the ultimate goal of many Buddhists. It represents the complete liberation from the cycle of suffering and the attainment of ultimate happiness and peace.

• The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice.
In summary, Dharma encompasses the core principles and teachings of Buddhism. It is the guiding light that leads individuals towards enlightenment and liberation from suffering. By understanding and practicing the Dharma, Buddhists strive to live meaningful and fulfilling lives.

Book: karma.txt

Karma is a central concept in Buddhism that refers to the law of cause and effect. It posits that our actions, thoughts, and intentions have consequences that shape our future experiences.
Key aspects of karma in Buddhism:
• Actions and consequences: Our actions, both physical and mental, have consequences that carry over into future lives.
• Intentions: Our intentions play a significant role in determining the consequences of our actions. Good intentions can lead to positive outcomes, while negative intentions can lead to negative outcomes.
• Cycle of rebirth: Karma is closely linked to the Buddhist belief in reincarnation. Our actions in this life can influence our future lives, determining whether we are reborn in a higher or lower realm.
• Liberation: The goal of Buddhist practice is to break free from the cycle of karma and achieve enlightenment. This involves cultivating positive actions, thoughts, and intentions, and eliminating negative ones.
Karma and the Four Noble Truths:
• Dukkha: The suffering we experience in life is often a result of past karma.
• The Origin of Dukkha: Craving and attachment, fueled by past karma, are the root causes of suffering.
• The Cessation of Dukkha: By eliminating craving and attachment, we can break free from the cycle of karma and achieve liberation.
• The Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha: The Eightfold Path provides a practical guide for cultivating positive actions, thoughts, and intentions, and eliminating negative ones.
Karma and compassion:
• Buddhists believe that understanding the law of karma can foster compassion and understanding for others.
• Recognizing that everyone is subject to the law of karma can help us to see others as beings who are also struggling and seeking happiness.
In summary, karma is a fundamental concept in Buddhism that explains the relationship between our actions and our experiences. By understanding and practicing the law of karma, Buddhists strive to cultivate positive actions, thoughts, and intentions, and to break free from the cycle of suffering and achieve enlightenment.

Explanation of Buddhism from Astalon18 who made this reply on http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism

You use the word Stream Enterer so I suspect you are practicing Theravada. Very well, I shall guide you in the tradition you have wished to follow and will explain to you the Theravada Buddhist worldview on the path of purification. 
You have correctly identified that in Theravada and in Mahayana there are two types of Buddhist, monastics and householders ( or what you call lay followers but technically we are more householders ). Technically speaking there are four orders of Buddhist ( yes, they are orders ) …. male monastics, female monastics, male householder, female householders. There is also an intermediary called anagarika who are the permanent eight precept holders who acts as the bridge between the monastics and the householders. The early Buddhist text describes them as householders who practices well and the idea that they are bridges between the householders and monastics is more a tradition in the last 1000 years. 
Now you must understand one thing about the Path of Purification which a Buddhist undertake .. you are only expected to follow the path to the degree that you are ready to undertake it. There is no “right degree” to take but rather there is the degree you are willing to undergo dependent upon your level of insight and very critically a sense of samvega. 
Unlike Christianity or Islam, Buddhism is not a yes or no religion in terms of level of training to undertake. Buddhism is fundamentally about purification of mind, it is a training in morality, kindness, insight and wisdom, and moving in the general direction of Nirvana. The critical point here is general direction …. as long as you are headed in that general direction this is wholesome. 
Which leads us back to the four orders .. why did the Buddha specifically create two orders .. the monastics ( one for male, one for female ) and the householders ( one for male, one for female ) with specific threshold of practice IF the intention was everyone practice the same. Why are the monastics minimally expected to take 10 Precepts as well as 227 total rules for male monks while for householders we are only expected to take 5 Precepts and every fortnight or month if we are devoted take one day of the 8 Precept ( if we choose to ). 
Ponder on this question for a moment. Ever realise that 95% of Buddhist only ever take 5 Precepts for their entire life? Are they bad Buddhist? Heck no, because this was what the Buddha Himself set into rule. Ever realise that most householders only ever practice metta meditation as their form of meditation, and not the protracted mindfulness ( the Buddha stressed loving kindness meditation a lot for householders but there really is only two suttas where a householder explicitly get taught mindfulness as we are taught now as opposed to a more direct reflection on sickness, death, ageing, causation etc.. Also historically mindfulness was only ever reliably taught to monks until the last 200 years. Yes our first record of mindfulness being actively taught to general householders was in the early 19th century. Previously mindfulness would only have been taught to householders who are 8 Precept holders, not to the whole group as we now do ) 
The answer is the Buddha did not intend everyone to practice to the same degree ( or He would just create one order ) 
This is because the Buddha knew that not everyone could undergo the full rigors of the path. However, moving in the general direction of the path itself is wholesome and can lead to Sotapanna ( stream entry ) or better rebirth ( if one did not achieve Sotapanna ). The householder practice is however specifically stated to be sufficient to lead to Sotapanna, so the householder practice is not deficient in this regard. 
So who was supposed to undergo the monastic training in the early text? They are those who undergo samvega ( ie:-existential dread ). These are people to whom they recognise the hollowness of conditioned existence and realise its total drawbacks, and as a result wishes to achieve liberation quickly. These are people who wants to achieve Arhathood in this lifetime or if not in this lifetime the quicker the better. 
So who was supposed to under to be under the householder training in the early text? These are those who sees the benefit of the Dharma as leading to (1) either cessation of suffering and thus liberation, and recognises to a limited degree the drawback of conditioned existence (2) sees the Dharma as the vehicle to lead to a happy and peaceful life (3) recognises the Dharma as a vehicle for a better rebirth. 
Notice that all three are equally valid. Some people wishes to bring about the cessation of becoming and being but unlike the monastic group have not experienced samvega hence lacks a sense of urgency ( ie:- they recognise it in their head, not their heart ). The second group, which I would dare say MOST Buddhist falls under is that we see the Dharma as the vehicle to lead to a happy and peaceful existence in this life. The third is those who just wants to be reborn in the Heavens. 
Many householders lead a worldly life. We enjoy gaming, they enjoy playing etc.. We work, we have careers. The Buddha supported us even in His days and gave teachings to us as in the Dighajanu Sutta ( ie:- Teachings suitable for householders ). The Buddha counselled Sigalaka in the Sigalovada Sutta on how to lead a good householder life and promised that this practice at the very least will lead to a Heavenly rebirth. The Buddha also kept assuring us that this practice alone can lead to Sotapanna so many householders who practices well probably die as Sotapannas. 
So what practice should all Buddhist keep if they are keen for Sotapanna? That is to practice the Five Precepts, practice dana ( generosity ), reflect daily on the Five Daily Recollections ( this is kind of important, while there is only one concise Sutta on this this practice is mentioned throughout numerous Suttas and the Buddha kept asking people to reflect on some of this things either partially or whole on a regular basis ), practice metta. Get to know the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Fold Path while keeping to the practice of the Five Daily Recollection and Metta. Read some Suttas. If you already know mindfulness practice, spend sometime to practice that. 
Remember there are two paths to Sotapanna, Dhamma followers and Faith Followers. Each can lead Sotapanna ( you should read up on faith follower and dhamma follower ). What I mention above encompasses both. If you have great analytics, you can become a Sotapanna. If you have great conviction in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, you also can become a Sotapanna. However both still needs Five Precept, Dana and constant reflections ( Dhamma followers analyses and after analysis, accepts, and this forms their reflection. Faith follower knows the teaching and accepts it on conviction ( but not so much analysis ), including really trusting the Buddha, and this forms their reflection ). 
Just doing this alone is sufficient to lead to Sotapanna, as remember what makes one a Sotapanna is instinctively right view, namely a recognition of anicca, anatta and dukkha as well as a sudden inability to break the Five Precepts intentionally. 
Now once become a Sotapannas there is now work to purify the mind ( yes, the mind of a Sotapanna is not wholly pure, it is still tainted by anger and greed but now it sees its drawbacks instinctively ). That is where the hardcore aspects of Buddhism kicks in. However you can legitimately wait till then to really work even harder. You will develop samvega probably around the same time. 
Do you now understand? 

Book: realms.txt

Realms in Buddhism refer to the different planes of existence that sentient beings can inhabit after death. These realms are determined by one's karma, or the law of cause and effect. The realms are categorized into three higher realms, three lower realms, and the human realm.
Higher Realms:
1. Deva Realm: This realm is characterized by happiness, pleasure, and luxury. Devas are beings of great beauty, intelligence, and power.
2. Asural Realm: This realm is characterized by conflict, jealousy, and pride. Asuras are often depicted as powerful but arrogant beings.
3. Brahma Realm: This realm is characterized by tranquility, peace, and wisdom. Brahmas are beings of great spiritual attainment and are often associated with creation.
Lower Realms:
1. Hell Realm: This realm is characterized by intense suffering, pain, and punishment. Hell beings are often depicted as suffering from various torments.
2. Animal Realm: This realm is characterized by ignorance, instinct, and suffering. Animals are often depicted as living simple, instinctual lives.
3. Hungry Ghost Realm: This realm is characterized by insatiable hunger and thirst. Hungry ghosts are often depicted as beings with large bellies and narrow necks, unable to satisfy their cravings.
Human Realm:
The human realm is considered a unique realm because it offers the potential for enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Humans are capable of both good and evil actions, and their future realms are determined by their karma.
It's important to note that these realms are not static and can change based on one's actions and karma. A person can be reborn in a higher or lower realm depending on their moral conduct and spiritual development. The goal of Buddhist practice is to break free from the cycle of rebirth and attain enlightenment, leading to liberation from suffering and the attainment of Nibbana.
