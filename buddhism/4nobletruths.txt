The Four Noble Truths are fundamental teachings in Buddhism that provide a framework for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. They are:    
1. Dukkha: This translates to "suffering" or "unsatisfactoriness." It encompasses all forms of suffering, including physical pain, mental anguish, and the inherent impermanence of life.
2. The Origin of Dukkha: This refers to the causes of suffering, which are rooted in ignorance, craving, and clinging.
3. The Cessation of Dukkha: This is the possibility of ending suffering through the eradication of its causes.
4. The Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha: This is the Eightfold Path, a practical guide for achieving liberation from suffering through ethical conduct, mental development, and wisdom.
These four truths form the core of the Buddhist understanding of the human condition and the path to enlightenment.

Expanding on the Four Noble Truths
1. Dukkha:
• Physical suffering: This includes pain, illness, and disability.
• Mental suffering: This encompasses negative emotions such as sorrow, anger, fear, and frustration.
• Existential suffering: This arises from the inherent impermanence of life, the unsatisfactoriness of worldly pleasures, and the inevitability of separation.
2. The Origin of Dukkha:
• Ignorance: This refers to a lack of understanding of the true nature of reality, leading to mistaken beliefs and desires.
• Craving: This is the desire for things that are impermanent, unsatisfactory, or harmful.
• Clinging: This is the attachment to things that are impermanent, unsatisfactory, or harmful.
3. The Cessation of Dukkha:
• Nirvana: This is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the complete cessation of suffering. It is a state of liberation from ignorance, craving, and clinging.
• Enlightenment: This is the realization of the true nature of reality and the attainment of Nirvana.
4. The Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha:
• The Eightfold Path: This is a practical guide for achieving liberation from suffering. It consists of eight interconnected elements: 
• Right View: Understanding the Four Noble Truths
