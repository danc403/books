Random thoughts on help with computers.

If you are asking for help with a computer problem, you do not understand or can not find what you want it to do or how to accomplish it.

This is the fundamental reason for asking for help.

If i ask what is on the screen, I do not want to hear the things you think apply and nothing else.

I am asking for every single detail of what you are looking at.

The main reason you are not able to accomplish your goal is you are leaving out information or skipping it even when reading to yourself.

It is always going to be something you did not think applied, otherwise you would have clicked it in the first place.



This means any text, buttons, links or even graphics.



There are times that you have to click something you don't think applies to get to the place it will apply.



This is a problem with most non technical users.

They always think they know what applies even though they look right at it and do not see it.

It is a problem of summarizing or not actually processing the full data stream their eyes are sending their brains.

I think it is a way to avoid overload on the visual cortex or its connection to the other parts of the brain.

It is not a personal failing but a biological one that is hard to overcome.

revised work in progress:

Describe everything you see on your screen. 

Don't worry about what seems important or not just read everything you see. 

This includes all the text, every button, and every link.

Sometimes the solution is hiding in a detail that seems completely unrelated, 

and it's something people tend to skip over. 

It’s a very common thing to do, but for this kind of problem, those small details are often the most critical clue. 

By telling me everything you see, you can help us find the right path and get this sorted out much faster. 

What do you see on your screen now?"
