**Chapter 16: Divide and Conquer**

The grimy air of the tunnels hung heavy, thick with the stench of decay and the residue of fear.
Anyas breath hitched in her chest, each inhale a reminder of the precariousness of their situation.
Bruno, his face etched with worry, led them deeper into the labyrinthine network, Timothys children huddled close to Sasha, their eyes wide with a mixture of terror and awe.
"The Assembly was supposed to be safe," Anya murmured, more to herself than to anyone else.
"How did the Hegemony find them?"

Bruno shrugged, his movements tight.
Spies are everywhere, Anya.
Especially when youre hiding in the belly of the beast.
Even those who claim to be on your side.

His words resonated with the growing dread that gnawed at Anyas gut.
The Keepers.
Lyra.
Silas.
The coded data burst, meant to reach Elias, had instead unearthed a viper's nest of conflicting loyalties and potential betrayals.
"We need to contact Rylan," Sasha said, her voice strained.
"See if he's alright.
Find out what's happening with the Keepers."

Anya shook her head.
No.
Too risky.
If there's a leak, any communication could be intercepted.
Rylan knows the contingency plan.
If he's compromised, he won't contact us.
And we absolutely cannot contact him."

She paused, a chill running down her spine.
What if Rylan was not just compromised, butconvinced?
The Keepers' vision of absorbing the Hegemony, a twisted assimilation rather than a true liberation, was horrifyingly plausible.
What if he had fallen under the sway of Lyra's influence?
Bruno stopped abruptly, gesturing towards a narrow alcove carved into the tunnel wall.
"This is as far as I can take you.
From here, the tunnels become even more unstable.
It is not safe for the children." He looked at Anya, his eyes pleading.
"I need to bring the children back to my people, and get them to safety."

"We understand," Anya said, though the separation felt like a new wound.
She watched him walk off with Timothy's children and turned back to Sasha.
The abandoned subway cart was cold and dark, and Sasha powered up the terminal and began analyzing the code.
It took nearly two hours, but Sasha finally looked up and said, "There is a fail safe.
If we continue down this path, there is no going back."

The weight of responsibility crashed down on Anya.
The subroutine, their supposed weapon of liberation, might be a trap, a tool of control masquerading as freedom.
But the Hegemony was closing in, and they were running out of options.
"We need to decide who to trust," Anya said, her voice barely above a whisper.
"Starting with each other."

She locked eyes with Sasha, searching for any sign of doubt or deception.
But she found only resolve, a mirror of her own determination.
"We are together," Sasha said.
"Until the end."

But Anya realized that she needed to put some other people to a test.
"Mara and Timothy are going to want to help us," Anya said.
"Mara has been a good friend and has helped in nearly every situation.
But there is something about her that just doesn't sit right."

"And Timothy wants his children back," Sasha added.
"How will you test them?"

Anya had a plan.
She would send a coded message to each of them, containing different pieces of the Unison's subroutine.
The messages would emphasize the urgency of their situation and the need for immediate action.
The messages would have the wrong information in it, though, so when they reported back, she'd know who she can trust.
"We tell them that the messages need to be delivered to Elias," Anya said.
"When the people are taken back to Elias, we will see what has been delivered."

As Anya and Sasha waited for the replies, the question that loomed largest in Anya's mind wasn't about the external threat of the Hegemony or the ambiguous motives of the Keepers.
It was about the bonds of trust forged in the crucible of survival.
Could they truly rely on anyone, or were they destined to face the final battle alone?
The clock was ticking, and the truth, like the echoes in the tunnels, was proving increasingly difficult to discern.
