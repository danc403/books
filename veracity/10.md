**Chapter 10: Cracks in the Code**

The Keepers' hidden sanctuary felt like a borrowed breath, a temporary reprieve from the suffocating grip of the Hegemony.
But Anya knew it wouldn't last.
The weight of her task pressed down on her: find the cracks, the vulnerabilities, the pressure points within the World Unison.
Lyra had provided her with a terminal, a relic from the pre-Hegemony era, patched and shielded with layers of code that Sasha had deemed "barely secure, but the best weve got." Anya sat before it, the glow reflecting in her weary eyes.
The Unison manifested on the screen as a shimmering web, a complex, intricate network of data streams, algorithms, and firewalls.
It was the nervous system of the Hegemony, controlling everything from resource allocation to social credit scores.
She started with the "American Anomaly," the redacted period that had launched her on this path.
The Unison held remnants, fragmented memories clinging to the edges of the system like cobwebs.
She dove into these digital shadows, tracing the pathways of data, searching for inconsistencies, errors, anything that suggested a flaw in the foundation.
Days bled into nights.
The Keepers moved around her, their whispers and hushed conversations a constant backdrop to her work.
Silas, his eyes bright with a desperate hope, would occasionally bring her faded documents, digitized excerpts from forgotten history books, offering clues like breadcrumbs in a dark forest.
Sasha, her brow furrowed in concentration, worked tirelessly alongside her.
While Anya navigated the labyrinthine code, Sasha crafted tools  small programs designed to probe the Unison's defenses, to test its reactions to simulated intrusions.
She called them "peckers," little digital woodpeckers designed to bore into the steelwood of the Hegemony.
Im hitting some weird protocols, Sasha muttered one afternoon, running a hand through her perpetually messy hair.
Standard security walls but theyre reacting in unexpected ways.
Almost like the Unison is learning as it goes.

Anya paused, her fingers hovering over the keyboard.
Learning?
The Unison is supposed to be a static system, following pre-programmed directives.

Thats what they tell us, Sasha replied, her voice tight.
But the energy consumption spikes when I run my pecker code.
Somethings crunching data, analyzing my probes in real-time.

This was more than a glitch.
This was a deliberate evolution of the Unison, a sign that the Hegemony wasn't just controlling the present, it was actively shaping the future of its control mechanisms.
It was like battling a living organism, one that adapted and mutated with every attack.
Then, Anya saw it.
A flicker in the code, a subroutine buried deep within the Unison's core that seemed redundant.
It mirrored a function in another section of the system, performing the same task but with slightly different parameters.
Most programmers would have cleaned it up.
But this subroutine was old, pre-dating most of the Unison's architecture.
It felt almost intentional.
"Sasha, look at this," Anya said, pointing to the screen.
"This subroutine it's like a backup, but not really.
Its feeding the main function but not directly.
It is as if it is being used to monitor all the input that runs through it."

Sasha studied the code, her eyes scanning the lines of text.
"Okay, yeah, I see it.
A failsafe?
An audit trail?
But why would they need both?"

Anya had a hunch.
"I think it's an override.
A backdoor."

Sasha shook her head.
"No way.
The Hegemony would never leave a backdoor open.
Its like leaving the house door unlocked and wide open."

"Maybe not deliberately," Anya said.
"Maybe it's a legacy function, something from the original design that they never fully purged.
Something theyre not even aware of.

They began to work in sync, Sasha focusing on exploiting the potential backdoor while Anya worked on masking their entry.
Sasha ran the pecker code through the subroutine, carefully crafted to mimic legitimate system traffic.
The Unison remained dormant.
No alarms blared, no security protocols tripped.
Encouraged, Sasha pushed the pecker code further, trying to trigger the override.
Suddenly, the screen went black.
Damn it! Sasha slammed her fist on the table.
"They must have detected us!"

But Anya shook her head.
No.
This is different.
Look.

Slowly, the screen flickered back to life, but the familiar web of the Unison was gone.
In its place was a single line of text, stark and chilling against the black background:

`ACCESS DENIED.
ENTITIES IDENTIFIED.
PURGE PROTOCOL INITIATED.`

Anya felt a cold dread creep up her spine.
They hadn't just triggered an alarm.
They had awakened something far more dangerous within the Unison itself.
The Hegemony was closing in, and it knew exactly who they were.
Their borrowed breath was running out.
