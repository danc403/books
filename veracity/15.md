**Chapter 15: Fractures**

The biting wind whipped through the gaps in the factory's corrugated iron walls, mirroring the icy unease settling in Anya's gut.
Sasha hunched over the makeshift workbench, lines of code scrolling across her face in a luminous green cascade.
The coded data burst had been sent; the waiting was excruciating.
Even more excruciating was the simmering distrust she felt towards the Keepers, a suspicion that had festered since the near-disaster at the terminal.
Anything? Anya asked, her voice tight.
Sasha shook her head.
Nothing yet.
Too soon to tell if Elias even received it, let alone if he can decipher it.

Anya ran a hand through her tangled hair.
The thought of Elias, trapped and vulnerable, gnawed at her.
They had taken a calculated risk, but the uncertainty was almost unbearable.
"If they find it, and decipher it, what if they find out about us?
The location of the factory?" Anya asked.
"We will cross that bridge if we get there," Sasha responded.
"We don't know where they are."

Anya didnt respond.
The quiet was soon broken by the sound of hurried footsteps outside.
Bruno burst in, his face etched with concern.
Mara and Timothy were close behind him.
Anya, we need to talk, Bruno said, his gaze sweeping the room.
I overheard somethingat The Assembly.

Anya tensed.
What?

Rumors, Bruno said, his voice low.
Whispers about a schism within the Keepers.
Some say Lyra is pushing forextreme measures.
That she sees the Hegemony not as an enemy to be defeated, but as a system to be *absorbed*, to be cleansed from within.

Anyas breath hitched.
Absorbed?
Butthats exactly what the Hegemony wants.

Exactly, Mara chimed in, "I had suspicions that Elias was a spy for The Keepers.
It would have been easy enough to have him captured after sending him to an easy job."

"I disagree.
We're all working together.
Even if Silas may be doing things for the greater good, I don't believe he would want his friend to be held captive." Timothy said, defending Silas.
Bruno nodded grimly.
Theres more.
Some claim Silas isnt the free-thinking historian we believe him to be.
That hesconditioned.
That Lyra has influence over him.
And that she always has.

The pieces of the puzzle clicked into place with sickening clarity.
The redundant subroutine, the convenient timing of their discoveries, the narrowly avoided captureit all pointed to a carefully orchestrated plan.
Lyra hadnt brought them into the Keepers; she had lured them into a trap.
Silas wouldnt do that, Anya said, her voice wavering despite herself.
She remembered his passion, his unwavering commitment to preserving the truth.
But doubt, like a persistent virus, had already infected her mind.
She knew the truth was always out there, it's that others didn't want it to be found, and she did.
I want to believe that, Anya.
But we cant afford to be naive, Bruno replied.
We need to consider the possibility that were being played.

Sasha finally looked up from her console, her expression grave.
Ive been running diagnostics on the Unison subroutine you wanted me to verify.
It's clean.
But I noticed something else.
Theres a secondary code embedded within it, a sort offailsafe.

Failsafe for what? Anya asked, dread pooling in her stomach.
Im not sure, Sasha said, her brow furrowed.
But its designed to be triggered under specific conditions.
Its subtle, but its there.
I'm not sure how to get rid of it."

She explained that, to trigger the subroutine, a specific amount of data must be sent into the local grid at specific times.
Then, after each burst, there must be a response from a single computer within that grid in a specific time frame, or the failsafe would be triggered.
Anya felt a chill run down her spine.
What were the odds of such specific triggers being met outside of the Unison's master plan?
This failsafe could destroy everything if they weren't careful.
Suddenly, a frantic beep echoed from Sasha's console.
I've got something!
A response to our coded data burst!
Butits garbled.
Encrypted with something I dont recognize.
It may be from Elias, but there's no way of knowing."

Hope flared within Anya, quickly tempered by suspicion.
"It may not be from Elias.
It may be the first signal to start the subroutine," Anya added.
"How are we supposed to determine if this is from Elias or not?" Mara questioned.
Anya thought for a moment.
"Mara, I need you to start creating a program that will be able to decipher the message.
I need you to act as quickly as possible, but also consider the possibility that this message is dangerous."

"What about Rylan and Silas?
Do you think they know about this secondary code and Silas being conditioned to be controlled?" Timothy questioned.
"I don't know.
I hope they do.
But we need to go and find out.
First, we need to break away from The Keepers." Anya spoke sternly.
"I've made my decision.
We can no longer trust The Keepers, not until we know the truth."

"Anya!
You're overreacting.
This sounds like paranoia," Mara responded.
"I'm sure Rylan and Silas are doing what they believe is right.
This will work out, I'm sure," Timothy tried to lighten the mood.
"I can see that there is an issue here.
But, Anya, we need to go with facts.
The data needs to be analyzed." Bruno added.
Anya stood firm, her gaze locking onto each of them in turn.
"We can't wait for perfect information.
We have to act.
The truth is being obscured, and we need to get to the truth."

She paced across the room, her mind racing.
How could they verify the message, determine the truth about Silas and Lyra, and decide what to do with the Unison subroutine  all while being hunted by the Hegemony and potentially betrayed by their allies?
She knew she must fight.
But with what or whom?
I think we need to get in touch with Rylan and Silas.
But we can't risk contacting them directly," Anya said.
"We have to act like they are enemies.
And it will hurt."

"Who are you planning to use?" Sasha asked.
"Timothy, I want you to go and find Rylan and Silas.
Tell them we received a message and Mara is trying to solve it.
However, tell them we no longer trust them and want to go another direction," Anya responded.
"But, Rylan would never betray us.
I trust him," Timothy stated.
"I understand that is how you feel, but we need to use everyone that we can.
Timothy, please!" Anya exclaimed, desperation in her eyes.
Timothy paused, but then complied.
"Bruno, I want you to go with Timothy to his location.
I do not want him going alone," Anya stated.
"That will work," Bruno responded.
"I can assist him in figuring out if the location that he is going to may be a trap."

"Excellent!" Anya responded.
"You two go now!"

Anya looked back at Sasha, who was working on the computer.
Her mind was racing at a million miles an hour and trying to solve the problem that she had in front of her.
"Anya, do you think the truth will set everyone free?" Sasha questioned.
"I hope it does," Anya responded.
"But it is not going to be that simple.
The only thing that I do know is that we need to do everything in our power to free the world from the lies of The Hegemony."

Anya walked outside for some air to clear her head.
The moon was dark, which gave Anya the space she needed to contemplate what her next actions would be.
