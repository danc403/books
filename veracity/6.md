# Veracity

**Chapter 6: Ghosts in the Machine**

Life on the farm had settled into a rhythm, a blend of backbreaking labor and meticulous planning.
But amidst the tilling of fields and the mending of fences, Anya remained fixated on the digital trail, on deciphering the "Weaponized Rhetoric" used during the American Anomaly, and understanding how the Hegemony mirrored those manipulative tactics on a global scale.
The cracked tablet, powered by a jury-rigged solar charger, became her window into a world of suppressed history and insidious lies.
Anya would often sit for hours staring at the tablet, carefully parsing through endless lines of code and data.
Her leg was still healing, but she was no longer bedridden.
She could hobble short distances, enough to join the others for meals and planning sessions, but the frustration of her limited mobility gnawed at her.
The physical limitations heightened her resolve to contribute through her mind, to use her skills to unravel the web of deceit spun by the Hegemony.
The former archivist began to correlate specific pre-Hegemony misinformation campaigns with the policies and practices of the current global order.
She studied old news articles, social media posts, and political speeches from the American Anomaly, identifying recurring patterns: the deliberate distortion of scientific facts, the demonization of opposing viewpoints, the appeal to fear and prejudice.
She focused on dissecting specific phrases that were frequently used.
"Fake News," "Deep State," and "Globalist Agenda." Silas had explained that these terms were deliberately vague, allowing them to be applied to anyone who challenged the radical administration's narrative.
It was a way of discrediting and silencing dissent.
These digital artifacts felt like echoes resonating through time, distorted and amplified by the Hegemony's global reach.
What struck Anya most was the subtlety, the insidious way the Hegemony had refined the art of manipulation.
Instead of outright lies, they favored carefully curated narratives, selectively highlighting certain facts while suppressing others.
They framed their policies in utopian terms  "Global Unity," "Sustainable Development," "Social Harmony"  while masking the darker realities of control, surveillance, and suppression.
"It's like they took the worst aspects of the American Anomaly and perfected them," Anya said during one of their evening planning sessions, the flickering lamplight casting long shadows on the faces of her companions.
Sasha, ever the pragmatist, nodded in agreement.
"They learned from the past," she said.
"They saw how misinformation could be used to divide and conquer, to consolidate power.
And they applied those lessons on a global scale." Sasha interrupted as she received data from an old friend who used to work for the World Unison.
She needed to be careful about whom she trusted.
The data Sasha was receiving suggested that certain districts were being put on lockdown, meaning that the World Unison was coming.
She was worried because many families and people she knew still lived there.
If she gave them a warning, the rest of the Veritas could be caught!
"So what do we do!?" Silas exclaimed!
"This means we are running out of time!
People are going to die!"

Anya realized the gravity of the situation, but she was not sure what they could do to change it.
She asked to speak to Sasha in private, so they hobbled out of the room.
"We need to think carefully, what are we going to do!" Anya stated.
"I am going to see what I can get from my friend from the archive."

Anya, despite her limited mobility, dedicated herself to sifting through the fragmented data, piecing together the puzzle of the Hegemony's manipulation.
She uncovered "Verifiable Divide" -- the subtle erosion of trust in any source of information deemed outside the "Global Unity" narrative.
This applied to small-town newspapers, independent blogs, and even dissenting academic research.
The Hegemony did not overtly ban these sources, but subtly undermined their credibility through targeted social media campaigns and the deliberate spread of counter-narratives.
These sources were then labeled "unreliable" and "divisive".
"We need to counter this," Anya declared one evening.
"We cannot just reveal the Hegemony's lies; we need to show people *how* they are being lied to."

Anya then tasked Bruno to bring someone who can communicate with the local communities surrounding their farm.
Bruno had a friend from the area who was called "The Mouth".
The Mouth could convince people to come or go, and had a knack for persuading.
"I want him to gather people from the community to come help us out!" Anya exclaimed.
"The more people we have, the better!"

"I am on it," Bruno said as he went to locate The Mouth.
With each piece of evidence, Anya's conviction grew stronger.
The Hegemony was not the benevolent unifier it claimed to be.
It was a sophisticated engine of control, a system built on the manipulation of information and the suppression of dissent.
Her past with the Archive was going to bring to light their downfall.
With each memory, she could see how the past was not as everyone thought it was.
"Sasha, I need your help.
I want to find the *first* instance of the phrase 'Global Unity' being used in Hegemony propaganda, before the Hegemony was the standard." Anya said, her voice strained.
"Who was the first public figure, before it was an enforced mandate, to push this idea?
What organization funded them?
I want everything."

Sasha nodded, her fingers already flying across the keyboard.
"I'll see what I can dig up," she said.
"But the Archive's records from that time are heavily guarded.
It will be difficult."

The following days were a blur of digital research, cross-referencing information, and deciphering coded messages.
Anya and Sasha worked tirelessly, fueled by a shared determination to uncover the truth.
They discovered that the phrase "Global Unity" had been popularized by a charismatic American politician named Senator Harrison Thorne, a key figure in the pre-Hegemony era.
Thorne had been a powerful advocate for global cooperation and international governance, arguing that it was the only way to prevent another American Anomaly.
"He was the perfect frontman," Anya said, her voice laced with bitterness.
"He used his influence to promote a vision of global unity, while secretly paving the way for the Hegemony's rise to power."

The problem, though, was that while Thorne was public, their data indicated that he was not the *true* mastermind.
What was the organization that helped fund him, and push the agenda?
They needed to dig deeper.
While Sasha and Anya were digging deep, Rylan and Elias were working on a transmitter with Clara.
It had been more than 2 months since they had arrived at the farm.
They were beginning to run low on rations, but there were multiple farms being established by the community members.
"Are you sure this is going to work?" Rylan asked, his brow furrowed with doubt.
Clara shrugged, her eyes glinting with mischief.
"It should," she said.
"I've tweaked a few things.
But it's all theoretical until we test it."

Elias attached the final wire, his hands shaking slightly.
"Alright," he said.
"Let's fire it up."

They held their breath as they activated the generator.
The machine sputtered to life, filling the air with the smell of ozone and burning metal.
The transmitter hummed, its antenna vibrating with energy.
The signal was weak and unstable.
The Hegemony's jamming technology was interfering with their broadcast.
"We need more power," Rylan said.
"And we need a way to bypass the jamming."

"I have an idea," Clara said, her eyes lighting up.
"There's an old military radar installation a few miles from here.
It has a high-powered transmitter.
If we can get it working, we can amplify our signal and break through the jamming."

The radar installation was located in a restricted zone, heavily guarded by Hegemony patrols.
Getting there would be risky, but they had no other choice.
If they wanted to broadcast their message to the world, they needed that transmitter.
The broadcast was going to begin soon, and that meant that they needed to ramp up operations.
There would need to be people out on watch.
Anya hobbled over and checked on Sasha.
"Anything on the organization?"

"It is a shadow government, I am sure.
It is a bunch of different organizations, many of them from the American Anomaly." Sasha answered.
"This goes deep, I am going to have to go deeper!"

Sasha looked at Anya.
"Do not go anywhere alone, the world is too dangerous."

As Sasha went back to digging deep, Anya went outside to stretch her legs.
As she looked out, the world seemed to be quiet.
Too quiet.
Then, gun shots rang out, and The Concorance were coming.
The time was now to defend.
Anya screamed to all: "THEY ARE HERE!!!
DEFEND!!!!"
