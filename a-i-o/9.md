The New Fluency
The sandbox incidents, while seemingly trivial to the outside observer, had merely been two of many such episodes that cemented Eleanor and Julian's peculiar dynamic. Day after day, their perfectly phrased observations of the world—whether building grand, if ultimately fragile, structures or navigating the complexities of sharing a toy—masked the simple joy or frustration of pure childhood. Across town, Beatrice and Samuel, too, continue their precise collaborations on whatever construction or game catches their attention, their little voices echoing words far beyond their years, yet applied with a child's directness to a world of play. They are growing up, like all children, only their words come out like filtered, perfect prose, even when describing something as basic as wanting a cookie or being mad at a sibling. The world around them, the adults especially, seems to simply accept it, perhaps because they have no framework to truly understand the subtle, jarring disconnect.
For Mr. Harrison, the pattern crystallized after Anya Sharma and Leo Finch's interviews. He sits at his desk, reviewing their digital profiles, a familiar weariness settling in. Another two, he thinks, another two perfectly polished, perfectly articulated candidates. He remembers Anya's confident, serene demeanor; her references to "optimal candidate profiles" and "unquantifiable human variables" are unsettlingly calm. He tried to push her on the human element, the messy, unpredictable side of leadership, but her answers, while logical, felt hollow. Like she was reading from a script. And Leo Finch was just the same. His "dynamic contingency frameworks" are textbook perfect, yet when Harrison pressed him on genuine human conflict, he reasserted that emotions could be "managed through structured de-escalation." Harrison has seen this before: perfect articulation, absolute confidence, but no real empathy, no genuine intuition for the unpredictable chaos of human nature. He finds himself missing the clumsy answers, the hesitations, the moments when a candidate fumbled for a word but showed a spark of real, messy insight. These new kids, they are fluent, yes. But the feeling? That is harder to find.
The change has been subtle, creeping in over a generation, almost imperceptible in its everyday infiltration. At first, it was celebrated. "I used to think it was amazing," a first-grade teacher might confide over lukewarm coffee, "how articulate they all are now. No more 'me go now.' It's always, 'I must depart at this juncture.' I honestly thought they were brilliant." Parents beamed as their toddlers used words like "inadvertently" or "consequently." "I used to brag about her vocabulary," a parent might share at the park. Teachers praised the improved articulation, mistaking it for increased comprehension. "But then I started to notice," the first-grade teacher would continue, "they can describe a historical event with perfect vocabulary, but they don't seem to grasp the tragedy of it. They don't feel the weight." The human element, the messy, beautiful, flawed human element, began to whisper its concerns. "My daughter explains why she doesn't want to share a toy with such precise logic, so flawlessly 
articulated, that I sometimes just nod," the parent would muse. "But I miss the 'Mine!' or the simple stomp of a foot. It feels... less real." The world, it seems, is becoming perfectly articulate, yet losing its voice. We feel it in the polite, formal conversations that never quite reach genuine connection. We notice it in the news reports, perfectly summarized and delivered, yet somehow missing the passion or outrage of real human experience. I find myself longing for a stutter, a slang term, an awkward silence—anything that feels genuinely lived.
