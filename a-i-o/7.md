Scene 7: The Tower's Second Ascent (Revised - Fourth Pass)
The scattered plastic bricks lay like colorful wreckage on the living room rug. Samuel, still clutching his "Leo the Luminary" robot, had stopped his wailing, replaced by the soft, sniffling sounds of post-cry exhaustion. Beatrice, kneeling amongst the debris, surveyed the situation with the calm air of a child deciding what to do next.
"Samuel," Beatrice said, picking up a long, green brick, "this structure was not strong enough before. It fell down because the bottom was not good." She held the green brick out. "This piece, I think, should be a better base."
Samuel looked at the brick, then at the remnants of his tower. "But... it broke. Will it just break again?" His voice was small, edged with doubt.
"If we build it better at the bottom, it probably won't fall down as much," Beatrice explained, though her eyes were mostly focused on sorting the red and blue bricks into neat piles. "I mean, we can make it more stable." She pushed a pile of smaller bricks towards him. "Maybe you can start sorting these little ones."
Samuel hesitated, then began to pick up the little bricks, his movements slow and methodical. "My Leo the Luminary robot was very unhappy when the tower fell," he murmured, gently patting his toy. "He was stuck under the blue ones. He said it was a bad situation."
Beatrice knelt, carefully retrieving the robot. "Ah, Leo the Luminary. He cannot work right now." She handed the toy back to Samuel, who clutched it. "About the bricks, Samuel, I believe the best thing to do is to put them back together. Building it again often makes it better." She gestured to the scattered bricks. "We can just rearrange them."
Samuel looked at the bricks, then at Beatrice, then at his robot, "Leo the Luminary." "Will it be tall again?" he asked, his voice still thick with recent tears, but his eyes beginning to show a glimmer of his usual childlike curiosity.
"If we plan it right, it can be tall again," Beatrice confirmed, already beginning to sort the bricks by color, as if preparing for a simple game.
