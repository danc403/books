Scene 8: Leo's Calculated Exit
The hum of the ventilation system was a low, steady presence. Leo Finch had just delivered his perfectly articulated answer about a "dynamic contingency framework," his gaze unblinking. Mr. Harrison considered him for a long moment, the pen in his hand still. He remembered when job candidates fidgeted, sweated, or even rambled a bit. This new breed was like a high-definition recording, polished to a mirror sheen.
"Mr. Finch," Mr. Harrison said, his voice even, "that's a very... comprehensive response. Now, let's consider something a bit more abstract. Project teams often face internal friction – personal disagreements, clashing work styles, even outright personality conflicts that aren't about data or resources. How do you, as a Project Manager, specifically address a significant human interpersonal conflict that threatens a project timeline?"
Leo’s composure didn't falter. Not a flicker. "Mr. Harrison, interpersonal conflicts within a team necessitate a structured mediation protocol. My approach would involve identifying the primary points of contention and facilitating a data-driven resolution. This involves encouraging transparent communication of individual objectives and identifying areas of suboptimal alignment." He paused, as if reviewing an internal script. "The objective is to return the team to optimal operational efficiency through conflict resolution and the re-establishment of a cohesive unit dynamic."
Mr. Harrison leaned back, a faint, almost imperceptible sigh escaping him. "So, you'd apply a protocol. What if the conflict isn't rational? What if it's just two people who simply don't like each other, and it's sabotaging everything? How do you deal with genuine, messy human emotion when your 'protocol' can't find a 'data-driven resolution'?"
Leo's eyes remained steady, his voice unchanging. "All human interactions, Mr. Harrison, operate within a predictable behavioral framework. While specific emotional manifestations may appear anomalous, their underlying drivers can typically be categorized and addressed through established psychological principles. The goal is always the re-establishment of collaborative functionality within the team unit. Emotional outbursts, while distracting, can be managed through structured de-escalation techniques and a focus on quantifiable task completion."
Mr. Harrison held Leo's gaze for another long moment. He nodded slowly, a movement that said more than words. "Thank you, Mr. Finch. That concludes our interview. We will be in touch regarding the next steps." He offered the same practiced, thin smile he'd given Anya, a smile that never quite reached his eyes.
Leo rose, his movements fluid and precise. "I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my qualifications, Mr. Harrison. I anticipate a favorable outcome." He executed a polite, almost military, nod and exited the room, the door closing with a soft click behind him.
Mr. Harrison watched the door for a moment, then slumped back in his chair. He pulled up Leo's digital file, the soft glow illuminating his weary face. Fluent, yes. And confident. Too confident, maybe. He thought about Leo’s responses, how perfectly phrased they were, yet how utterly devoid of any real understanding of human messiness. It was like listening to a machine recite poetry – all the right words, none of the soul. He remembered a time when you could tell what someone really thought by the way they hesitated, or changed a word, or even swore a little. Now, it was just... seamless. He made a note: "Excellent verbal articulation. Lacks demonstrated capacity for empathetic leadership or nuanced interpersonal mediation. Recommend standard consideration." He then leaned back in his chair, the hum of the ventilation system a steady reminder of the new normal.
