Scene 1: The Children's Playground (Revised - Fifth Pass)
The sandbox was a chaos of fine grit and flung plastic, exactly as any proper sandbox should be. A couple of parents sat on a nearby bench, faces tipped to the sun, occasionally glancing up from their screens. You'd think the squealing and the bits of sand clinging to every surface would get to them, but most seemed to have developed an impressive filter.
Seven-year-old Eleanor Vance, her knees already streaked with the day's first layer of grime, knelt over a meticulously constructed sandcastle. "Julian," she said, her voice clear, "this structure feels a bit unstable. It's not holding up good on this side." She poked at the sand with a small spade. "I get annoyed when my castles fall down."
Six-year-old Julian Reed, who was currently attempting to eat a handful of sand despite Eleanor's prior warnings, paused. He slowly lowered his sandy hand, a few grains still clinging to his lower lip. "Okay, Eleanor," he mumbled. "I think the wind is making it weak. We should put more wet sand." He then immediately scooped up another, smaller handful of sand, his eyes wide. "I just really want to investigate it."
Eleanor nodded, a small, resolute bob of her head. "Yup. You're right about the wind. Go get the water." She frowned, watching him. "Eating sand is a really unwise choice."
Julian, abandoning his sandy snack with the efficient detachment of a well-programmed drone, scrambled up and headed for the nearby water fountain, a small, purposeful figure already halfway to the splashing fixture. He was still wearing mismatched socks and his shirt was on backward, the little cartoon rocketship on the back facing the wrong way.
"Look, Eleanor," Julian called back, holding a small, red plastic cup under the gushing water, his voice carrying clearly across the playground, "the way this water goes reminds me of the bad guy in 'Galactic Guardians: The Quantum Quandary'â€”Anya, the Administrator, whose disruptive powers always stopped the good guys." He giggled then, a sudden, gasp, as the water sloshed over his hand, revealing a childlike fascination with the simple overflow.
Eleanor, momentarily distracted from her architectural duties, tilted her head. "Yeah. Anya's way of cooperating was always a problem for the good guys. But her way of sharing stuff was pretty efficient." She sighed, a surprisingly common sound from her, then returned her full attention to the castle, truly just thinking about how to keep the sand together.
