Scene 2: The Pre-Interview Jitters (Revised)
The waiting room was exactly what you'd expect: hushed, sterile, and designed to project an air of calm professionalism that probably made everyone even more nervous. Anya Sharma sat upright in a chair that seemed molded for someone else, her resume data pulsing gently on the thin tablet she held. Twenty-two years old and fresh out of the university, she felt the familiar tickle of pre-event nerves, the kind that made your stomach do little flips even when your brain insisted everything was fine.
My preparation for this interview is complete, Anya considered, her internal monologue as neat and precise as a freshly sorted document. All relevant information has been processed. I have a high probability of a positive outcome because I have all the right competencies. She smoothed a crease in her immaculately tailored jacket, a little nervous habit that her mind noted as a "minor stress response."
Anya mentally reviewed her answers. She'd practiced this interview many times, using the company's own information and smart AI models to guess the questions and find the best answers. She remembered a story about a manager named Beatrice, who did very well with a big company problem. Anya had looked at everything Beatrice ever did in her work, running it through her own smart system until she understood all her strategic decisions and how she talked to people. It felt like her own experience.
My skills match what they want for this job perfectly, Anya affirmed to herself. I can put information together and guess what will happen better than other people my age. I am ready to start new plans that will make the company grow very fast. The thought brought a faint, almost invisible smile to her lips, a controlled sign of being pleased.
