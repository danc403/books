Scene 3: A Moment of Childhood "Wisdom" (Revised - Third Pass)
The plastic brick tower, a precariously balanced monument to youthful ambition, finally gave way. It exploded in a scattering of primary colors across the worn living room rug, and five-year-old Samuel O'Connell let out a wail that could probably be heard three blocks over. He wasn't crying because he was hurt, just because his magnificent creation was now a flat, defeated mess.
Eight-year-old Beatrice Chen, perched on the armrest of an oversized armchair, paused her intense engagement with a digital tactical game on her handheld device. She observed Samuel's distress with a calm gaze. "Samuel," she said clearly, "you are feeling very unhappy. The falling down of your bricks seems to be the reason."
Samuel just wailed louder, pointing a chubby, accusing finger at the scattered bricks. "It broke! It broke!"
Beatrice slid off the armchair, approaching the chaos with measured steps. "Yes, the bricks are not together anymore. However, we can reconstruct it, maybe making the bottom part stronger so it does not fall again." She picked up a yellow brick. "I think the way it was built before was not very good for staying up."
Samuel stopped crying abruptly, his lower lip still trembling, but his eyes wide as he looked at the scattered bricks. "But... it's all broken. And my 'Specialist' robot got stuck under the blue one!" He pointed to a small, blocky toy robot partially buried under a large blue brick. "He can't do his job when he's stuck!"
Beatrice knelt, carefully retrieving the robot. "Ah, Leo the Luminary. He cannot work right now." She handed the toy back to Samuel, who clutched it. "About the bricks, Samuel, I believe the best thing to do is to put them back together carefully. Doing things carefully often makes them better." She gestured to the scattered bricks. "We can put them in a different order."
Samuel looked at the bricks, then at Beatrice, then at his robot, "Leo the Luminary." "Will it be tall again?" he asked, his voice still thick with recent tears, but his eyes beginning to show a glimmer of his usual childlike curiosity.
"If we plan and build it well, it will probably be tall again," Beatrice confirmed, already beginning to sort the bricks by color.
