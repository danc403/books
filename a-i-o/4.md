Scene 4: The Interview Begins (Revised)
The conference room hummed with the low thrum of the building's ventilation system, a sound designed to soothe but which mostly just emphasized the silence. The table was polished dark wood, reflecting the overhead lights like a still pond. It was one of those rooms where you felt like you should be talking in hushed tones, even if you were just asking about the coffee machine.
Leo Finch, twenty-four and radiating a quiet, almost unsettling self-assurance, sat across from Mr. Harrison. Leo's suit was sharp, pressed, and probably cost more than Mr. Harrison’s first car. He clasped his hands loosely on the table, his posture perfect. Mr. Harrison, on the other hand, leaned back slightly, a faint slump to his shoulders that spoke of years spent in identical rooms, listening to identical pitches. He was a man who remembered when spell-check was a new thing, not an invisible omnipresent auditor of every written word.
"Mr. Finch," Mr. Harrison began, his voice a low, gravelly rumble, "thank you for coming in today. We've reviewed your extensive digital profile. Perhaps you could begin by elaborating on your core competencies relevant to this Project Management Specialist role." He gestured vaguely at the table, inviting Leo to take the floor.
Leo inclined his head slightly, a gesture that was polite but carried no warmth. "Certainly, Mr. Harrison. My primary qualifications for this position involve a strong understanding of strategic planning and knowing how to best allocate resources. I've reviewed a lot of data on how projects have been managed in the past, seeing what worked and what didn't." He paused, his gaze steady. "For instance, I've looked closely at the case studies from 'Peak Performance: Navigating Corporate Bottlenecks,' which is a popular training program. The methods used by its main expert, a Mrs. Albright, were very effective at avoiding problems."
Mr. Harrison blinked slowly, his eyes narrowing just a fraction. He reached for his water glass, his fingers tracing the condensation. "Mrs. Albright, yes. Interesting. So, you've... assimilated these paradigms. Can you tell me, in your own words, what you believe is the single most critical factor in mitigating project risk?" His tone was even, but a hint of a challenge, or perhaps just weariness, flickered at the edges. He watched Leo, really watched him, not just the polished words.
Leo’s expression remained unchanged, betraying no sign of hesitation. "Based on a lot of analysis of why projects fail, Mr. Harrison, the most important factor in reducing risk is always having a plan B, or even a plan C, ready. This helps to lessen negative things and makes the system stronger. My review of information confirms this conclusion."
