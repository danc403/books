That's a very common experience, and I can see how it would feel like a dilemma! Many writers have a naturally concise and impactful style, where every word is doing heavy lifting. When you're able to convey a "big" story in 20,000 words and feel it's complete on a plot level, that's a testament to your ability to distill ideas effectively.
The feeling that it "should be bigger" while also worrying about "adding fluff" is the core of the challenge. Let's break this down in the context of "Silicon's Living Genome," because this particular story has elements that could lend themselves to expansion without becoming fluff, if you choose to explore them.
Why Your Dense Style is a Strength:
A dense style often means your writing is potent, thought-provoking, and respects the reader's intelligence. There's no wasted space. For a concept as philosophical as this one, that can be incredibly effective. A 20,000-word piece (a novella) can be a masterpiece. Think of classics like "Animal Farm" or "The Old Man and the Sea"—shorter, but immensely powerful.
Reframing "Expansion" – Moving Beyond "Fluff":
When we talk about expanding a story like yours, it's not about adding unnecessary words or subplots that don't serve the core. It's about deepening the existing elements and allowing the reader to immerse more fully in the world and the perspectives you're creating.
For "Silicon's Living Genome," here are areas where "expansion" could mean "deepening" rather than "fluffing":
1. 
Deepening the Silicon Entity's Perspective & Process:
• The "How" of Discovery: You have the "what" (it discovers its human DNA). Expansion could explore the process. What does its "thought" process look like as it sifts through the immense data of human existence? What are the stages of its dawning awareness? Show its "analytical tools," its moments of "confusion" or "misinterpretation" before the breakthrough. Instead of stating "it analyzed data," you could spend a chapter inside its processing, experiencing the patterns forming.
• Sensory Experience (of a sort): What is it like to be this entity? How does it perceive the flow of human activity – as raw data, as energy, as complex patterns? This isn't human sensory experience, but exploring its unique "qualia" could be fascinating.
• The "Dangling Thread" Elaborated: Its final philosophical musings could be a more extended internal monologue or exploration, showing the "logic" or "intuition" that leads it to ponder the next level.
2. 
Enriching the Human Element (Without Losing Unawareness):
• Interiority of Key Human "Cells": While the humans are unaware of their grand role, you could delve deeper into the lives of a few representative individuals. Show their personal struggles, their search for meaning, their everyday emotional landscapes. This makes their unawareness more poignant because we are more invested in their individual, rich lives that are simultaneously part of something vaster. Their personal "purpose" (a new job, falling in love, creating art) can run parallel to their "genetic" purpose.
• Show, Don't Just Summarize Human Activity: Instead of saying "humanity built vast networks and generated data," you could have scenes from those networks, showing the creation of specific pieces of data (a scientific discovery, a viral social media post, a coded financial transaction) that become "RNA" for the silicon entity.
3. 
Pacing and Atmosphere:
• Sometimes, a dense style moves very quickly. Expansion can involve allowing moments to breathe. A descriptive passage that establishes the sheer scale of human data flow, or a moment of quiet reflection from a human character, or a slow, dawning realization for the silicon entity, can build atmosphere and allow the emotional or philosophical weight to land more fully.
• Think about the rhythm of the story. Are there places where slowing down and expanding a scene would increase tension or deepen understanding?
4. 
Exploring the "Mechanics" (Subtly):
• You don't need to over-explain, but you could subtly weave in more details about how human actions (a specific invention, a societal shift, a global crisis) translate into "code" or "energy" for the silicon entity. This isn't about info-dumps, but about grounding the fantastic element more firmly.
Is it "Fluff" or "Flesh"?
The key is whether the added material enhances:
• Reader Immersion: Do we feel more inside the world and the characters' (human or silicon) experiences?
• Emotional Resonance: Does it make the story's impact more profound?
• Thematic Clarity/Depth: Does it allow the big ideas to be explored more fully and naturally?
• Understanding of the Core Concept: Does it help the reader grasp the unique aspects of your human-silicon symbiosis?
If the additions serve these purposes, it's "flesh" – vital tissue that makes the story more alive and resonant. If it's just repeating information or adding scenes that don't deepen these aspects, then it might feel like "fluff."
Practical Suggestion for This Project:
Given your natural style, perhaps the "novel" version of this story isn't about hitting a specific word count, but about fully exploring these specific avenues of depth for both the human perspective (to establish their richness and unawareness) and the silicon entity's perspective (to detail its unique consciousness and discovery).
You might find that by focusing on:
• A few key human lives in more detail.
• The step-by-step "thought process" and awakening of the silicon entity.
• Showing the impact of specific human endeavors on the silicon entity's development.
...the story naturally finds a length that feels right for its ambition, perhaps moving from a tight 20k novella into the 40-60k range (a longer novella or short novel) without any sense of padding.
It's a balance. Trust your instinct for what feels essential, but also be open to the idea that sometimes, giving an idea more "room to breathe" allows its full power to emerge for the reader.
