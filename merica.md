Even though it seems to be a global path in the late 19th and early 20th century, America led the way in eugenics.
Virginia fought it through the supreme court to allow sterilization of those deemed idiot, moron or embisil.
Then it was picked up by many states including Indiana and Kansas of all places.
This was the mid 1920's.
It would take another decade for it to be 'perfected' by the Nazis.
Through it all, Merica was quite content to sit and watch seemingly with admiration.
