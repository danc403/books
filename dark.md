Dark Path to Eutopia
Dan Carpenter
Creative Non Fiction

Start with the eugenics movement, move to the discovery of genetics and cloning and the Row case with its implications of positive eugenics.
Move n to the possible future in which there would be no need for abortion as couples could have children on their terms meaning most biological mutations can be repaired invitro and no one would become pregnant unless they chose to.
This will most likely be a precursor to a true post scarcity society.
